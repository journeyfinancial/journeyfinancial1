    Journey Financial Consulting is a comprehensive financial advising and
    planning firm that is passionate about empowering clients to take ownership
    of their finances, while educating them on topics pertaining to personal
    finance. 


    Along your financial journey there are many events which merit an
    independent, third-party review of your financial situation.  As the
    consulting services are offered at an hourly rate, you have the flexibility
    to decide the scope of our engagement.


    The consulting services will add value whether you:


    * have just a few questions;

    * need some help following a life milestone;

    * want to know if you have enough to retire; or

    * require a full financial plan.

    Complementing the consulting services, are an array of tools which will help
    make your financial journey easier!  Reading a financial plan is not enough,
    you need simple tools to make sure you can manage your finances on an
    ongoing basis.  Understanding rates of return, asset allocation and your net
    worth, allow for the assessment of the success of your financial journey.




    In addition, in reviewing your financial position there are opportunities to
    benefit from resources which can save you money.

    This technique is a means of converting your mortgage debt into a leveraged
    portfolio which benefits from the interest being tax deductible.  While this
    strategy is not without risk, with proper planning and a long-term approach
    the benefits include:


    * paying off your mortgage faster using the dividends from your investment
    portfolio;

    * building an investment portfolio with every dollar of principal you repay
    on your mortgage; and

    * reduced taxes.
